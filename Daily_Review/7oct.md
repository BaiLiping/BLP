It is too much cost to be the person upholding principal values. Think of Javat, or that east-european woman. Yet, single-mindedly against established social norms can only be as bad. The only winning position: uphold the rules when it is not important to me. After all, that is the cheapest option. When things get costly, see if there is a narrow path forward. That path is usually hard to find.

ability to solve problems and figure things out.
