1. how many times people are going after ideals that does not exist?
   why do people draw energy out of an ideal?
2. out of all the possibility space of different versions of life, the outcome which is good is actually a very limited subspace. Which is why constraints place a key role in finding that subspace, otherwise too much time would be spent exploring optings with too few potential gain. People impose contraints on themselves either because authority figure told them so;or life imposed that contraints on them; or, the best kind, they figured things out early enough and decided to limit themselves to the greedy policy, i.e. policies that been proven to work over the generations. 
3. target for today, finish up assignment from cs231n, have better understanding of numpy and pytorch.
4. activation function, hyperspace image and universal function approximator
5. is there a way to embedding physical understandings into the deep network?
   how to integrate control schemes such as linear quadratic regulator, model predictive control and reinforcement learning.
6. reviewing the scrambling of CNN
7. can i apply RNN to the phased array problem?
8. what are some of the best ways to understand thony concepts:
9. the relationship between max log-likelihood and cross entropy.
10. Baysian Actor_Critic Method
how to fit baysian statistics into the updating scheme.
