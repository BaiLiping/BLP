the idea of an insurance for PCB or semiconductor innovators



issuer of this insurance: manufacturer association

purpose of this insurance: to encourage new semiconductor or PCB design

clearing process for this insurance: if a new design was deemed defective by industry standard, then the manufacture would make a batch of new design. The manufacturer association, the issuer of this insurance would payout the amount based on the original quote.





introduction: Innovation for new PCB and semiconductor design is encouraged by the government and institutions alike. Yet, the cash-flow required to bring an innovative idea to bear might be prohibitive for most small labs and companies. Simulation is an integral design tool for validation of a new design but it is by no means omnipotent. Often times, a new PCB and semiconductor design which works in simulation does not function in 'proof of concept' small batch manufactured product.  Trial and errors are necessary to sort out all the kinks, and often is what large electronic and semiconductor companies budget for. How to make this trial and error step, which is cash flow heavy, available to more small scale labs and companies is what this paper is set out to address.

The PCB and Semiconductor proof of concept Insurance would be underwritten by industry sanctioned insurance companies. Issued to any PCB or Semiconductor manufacturing customers in their 'proof of concept' small batch manufacturing stage of development process. If a batch is issue free after manufacturing, then the insurance holder can not claim any damage. On the other hand, if the design is proven to be defective, then the insurance holder can adapt their design and manufacture another small batch.
