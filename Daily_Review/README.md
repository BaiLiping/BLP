this is a daily review/next day planning from 2019 September onward.

I find the key contributing factors to my productivity are:

1. start the day with review of the day prior.
2. tackling the difficult conceptual jumps in the morning.
3. have a detailed plan at night for the next day.

this folder is my attempt to implement that in a systematic manner.
