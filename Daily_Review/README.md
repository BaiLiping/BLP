this is a daily review/next day planning from 2019 September onward.

I find the key contributing factor to productivity:

1. start the day with reviews of elements from the prior day.
2. tackling the difficult conceptual jumps in the morning
3. have a detailed plan at night for the next day.

this folder is my attempt to implement that in a systematic manner.
