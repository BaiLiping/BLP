1. importance sampling bring enormous gains, making an otherwise infeasible problem amenable to Monte Carlo. It is one of the hardest variance reduction method to use well.

2. Importance sampling is more than just a variance reductioni method. It can be used to study one distriburtion while sampling from amother. It is an important prerequisite for sequential Monte Carlo.
