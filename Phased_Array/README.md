The Phased Array project is designed as a tool to facilitate learning, major components include:
1. PCB Driver Design
2. MicroController Code
3. Control Algorithm using Reinforcement Learning


While learn by doing is the only way I know how to really understand a subject, when there is a time constraint one need to be smart about how much doing is optimal to illustrate a concept. There would be a point of diminishing return. 

Technology as a subject has a way to suck you in, every step of the way. Operating System, Database System, Communication Protocols, Algorithm and Datastructures, everything can sink limitless amount time if you are not careful.
