1. Ternary Operator:
   (condition)?(if true):(if false)
   eg: int a = (l1=NULL?0:100);

2. ctr+v block visual
   I, insert
   Normal Mode, group comment

3. int a; externally linked static variable if other file want to use it, exter int a to tell the compiler it is defined at some other file;
   static int a; internally linked static variable. to tell the compiler that this variable should only be used in the scope of this file;
   static int a, inside of a block, i.e. function. to tell the compiler that this variable is only viable in this block;

4. reference and ptr
   reference does not change after initialization and can not point to NULL. in a function to pass a reference ,you only need to provide the name of the variable.
