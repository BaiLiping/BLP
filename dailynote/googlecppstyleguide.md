1. do not make heap allocated object static duration.
2. the order of declaration: public, protected, private
3. naming covention, using underscore. for datamembers, using trailing underscore. using namespace such that the names can be more intuitive and shortter. Comment on the end bracket such that the ownership of that bracket is clear.
4. comment, i think can be a good practice for me to comment on the end of bracket, marking this bracket, considering the amount of time I spent on sorting out the bracket stuff. 
function should be commented on how to use, as does classes.
6. need to know more about movable and copyable object and the operations, pros and cons associated with it. 
7. a variable should have as narrow a scope as possible
8. prefer initialization over assignment or declaration, initialization prefer bracket initialization.
