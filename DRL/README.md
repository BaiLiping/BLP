Books for DRL:
Statistical Learning (quite a lot stats concepts made its way into DRL, such as importance sampling, KL divergence, Heffoling Inequalities etc. It is a good background)

RL by Rich Sutton (Approximation with NN is a new development, but the overall structure of RL is still what Rich Sutton lays out in his book: Dynamic Programming->Monto Carlo->TD(0)->TD(lambda))->Tabular Methods->Q-learning->Generalization with Function Approximations->Policy Gradient->Actor-Critic with Advantage, also the distinction between on-policy learning, off-policy learning
