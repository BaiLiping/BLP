a copy constructor is a constructor that has one parameter that is of the same type as the class. The one parameter must be a call-by0reference parameter, and normally the parameter is proceded by the const parameter modifier, so it is a constant parameter. In all other respect, a copy constructor is defined in the same way as many other constructor and can be used just like other constructors.
