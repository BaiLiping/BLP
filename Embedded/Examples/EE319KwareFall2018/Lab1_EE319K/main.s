; Brief description of the program: Fall 2018 Lab1
; The objective of this system is to implement odd-bit counting system
; Hardware connections: 
;  Output is positive logic, 1 turns on the LED, 0 turns off the LED
;  Inputs are negative logic, meaning switch not pressed is 1, pressed is 0
;    PE0 is an input 
;    PE1 is an input 
;    PE2 is an input 
;    PE3 is the output
; Overall goal: 
;   Make the output 1 if there is an odd number of 1's at the inputs, 
;     otherwise make the output 0

; The specific operation of this system 
;   Initialize Port E to make PE0,PE1,PE2 inputs and PE3 an output
;   Over and over, read the inputs, calculate the result and set the output

; NOTE: Do not use any conditional branches in your solution. 
;       We want you to think of the solution in terms of logical and shift operations
